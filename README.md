# Course Overview
This course is a foundational course in the MS in Data Science program, introducing core methods
and theories in statistical analysis. The course prepares students to carry out independent research
and interpretation of data analyses to address research questions. The course provides an
introduction to the use of R and RStudio for statistical programming.


# Objectives and Course Topics

### Students in this course will
  - Apply a range of data visualization methods
    
  - Develop models for data, and apply statistical techniques to assess the validity of the
models

      * Use parametric and nonparametric methods for examining a single sample and two-
sample means

      * Apply linear regression
  
  - Derive sound theoretical footing for the methods, where practical, to guide them as they

      * Check data requirements
      
      *  Apply method diagnostics
      
      * Interpret results
      
  - Report results of analyses of real-world data using course methods
    
  - Use basics of R, a widely used programming language for statistical analysis
    
### Topics covered include

  - Fundamentals of probability spaces
  - Basic data visualization
  - Summary statistics
  - Concept of hypothesis testing
  - One- and two-sample tests: Wilcoxon, t, and z
